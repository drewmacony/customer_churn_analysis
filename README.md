## Project Structure

The project follows the CRISP-DM framework:

1. **Business Understanding**: Define the problem and set up criteria for success.
2. **Data Understanding**: Analyze the available datasets to explore relationships between features and answer business questions.
3. **Modeling**: Build a predictive model to forecast the target variable (churn).
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics.
5. **Deployment**: Provide a business impact assessment and final recommendations based on the model's performance.
